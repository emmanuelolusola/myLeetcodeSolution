example ==> [1, 2, 3, 4]
    - result ===> [1, 2, 3, 5]
        - from the array, the number is 1234
        - adding one to it makes is 1235

- because we are adding to the last number of the array;
    - we loop backward, starting our first value from the last element of the array
    - we add one to the last element


===> but there is a condition
    - if the last element of the array is 9;
        - we won't have 10 as the last element, because it does not sum up the elements of the array
            - i.e plusOne([4, 3, 2, 9]) != [4, 3, 2, 10]
            - it is [4, 3, 3, 0], because 4329 + 1 = 4330

    - in this case;
        - if last number of the array is 10 after adding 1;
            - initialize the last element to be 0
            - and add 1 to the next element to the left (through iteration done above)

        - then return the result
