- Inside function,
    - we need two variable,
    - one is sum and other is carry.
    ====> Sum variable will be return as output.

    - Assign empty string to Sum variable.
    - Assign zero to Carry variable.
- To add numbers we need to run loop
    - use while loop it run till a or b and carry is not empty.
    - After every iteration, we will remove last element from input a and b.


- Inside while loop,
    - we need to add last digits of a and b, and store it in variable add.
        - If add is greater than 1
            - 0 is added to the sum
            - reassign Carry with 1.
        - In else case we just need to add value of Carry, and reassign Carry with zero

===> Need to remove last digit from inputs a and b, if not remove while loop will run infinate times.
