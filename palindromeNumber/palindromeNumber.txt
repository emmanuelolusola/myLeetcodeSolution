- if number is negative, it's false => can never be palindrome
    example: -123 is 321- , -11 is 11-, -121 is 121-

- create a new variable that takes the reverse of the number
- reverse through iteration:
    - val is the initial number
    - val is greater than or equal to 1
    - last number of the val is being removed through iteration

        - set reverse to be previous reverse * 10 plus new val after iteration
            example:
            number => 123
            val = 123, next iteration (val = 12)
            reverse = 3
            new val = 12, next iteration (val = 1)
            reverse = (3 * 10) + 2 = 32
            new val = 1 ===> last iteration
            reverse = (32 * 10) + 1 = 321 ====> REVERSE
