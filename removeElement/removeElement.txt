- To remove element from an array;
    - we iterate through the array
    - then remove the target number

- because we are removing from the array,
    looping forward will have us decrement the index of the next array for another operation
        ===> because the length of the array reduces after removing an element.

- best way to iterate and remove element without having to decrement index of next operation is:
    - loop backward ===> indices of all elements of the array remain unchanged.

- Then we return the length of the array after removing target elements
