Using vertical method,
    we check through all the strings in the array,
    we record the longest substrings that match substrings of other strings at the same index
    
    example:
                |A|-|P|-P-L-Y
                |A|-|P|-P-L-E
                |A|-|P|-E
                |A|-I-D
                 ======> since I (str[3][1]) is not the same as P (str[2][1])
                    break out of the loop ==> ignore the rest of the operation
                    Return A as the longest common prefix.


PSEUDOCODE
- if the strings are empty, record NO COMMON PREFIX ==> Edge case
- loop through the characters of the strings (char, index)
    - loop through the strings in the array
        - if string[index] != char
            - return the prefix
    - add character to prefix
- return prefix
