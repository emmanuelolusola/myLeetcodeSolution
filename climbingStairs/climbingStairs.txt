====> Breaking down problem
    considering we can take 1 step or 2 steps throught the stairs to reach end of stairs
            POSSIBILITIES
        stairs      |       steps
           1        |         1
           2        |         2
           3        |         3
           4        |         5
           5        |         8
           6        |         13

===> From the table above,
    - the steps taken at a stair[3] = sum of steps taken at stair[2] and stair[1]
    - the steps taken at a stair[6] = sum of steps taken at stair[5] and stair[4]
        - therefore steps taken at a stair[current] = sum of steps taken at stair[current - 1] and stair[current - 2]
