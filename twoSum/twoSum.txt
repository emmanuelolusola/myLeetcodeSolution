Using two pointer;
    - given an array of numbers, and a target number
    - if two numbers in the array sum up to the index
        - return the indices of the two numbers

    ==> Approach
        - create a new array map that takes in the index of the two numbers
        - iterate through the array of numbers
            - create a new variable that takes the number in the array (from the start)
                - i.e a = nums[i]
            -  create another variable that takes the subtraction of "a" from the target number
                - i.e b = target - a

            - if the array contains "b"
                - get its index 

            add the index of a and b to the array map
